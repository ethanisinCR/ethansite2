        <p><em>Founder of this website</em></p>
        <p>Ethan Galloway is the former owner and operator of a contruction company
          in Mississippi. He recently sold some of his equipment and trucks to move
          to Costa Rica for a better life full of web developing and surfing. He has
          realized in this life there is more to just working everyday 9-5, or in his
          case most days 7-8 or later. He encourages everyone who wants a life of
          freedom and flexibility to pursue a career online that allows for the better
          things in life to be easily attainable. </p>
